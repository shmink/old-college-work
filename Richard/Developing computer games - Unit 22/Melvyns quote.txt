Tom seems to have laid out a solid base for the game in wish he intended to create. The driving mechanic is fluid and smooth with no feeling of latency or un-responsiveness unlike other top-down driving games that I have played. He has used graphics that work well together and subtle shadows to enhance to bright and feel-good look of the game. It would be nice to see the game to the level that it was intended to be, but with the time limit so tight it would be unfair to say that this wasn't a good attempt.
