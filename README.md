# College work back up

A games development course. Using C# mainly but also touching on other IT information generally. I think (it's been 5 years) the structure is the lecturer of a particular modules then more specific units within them.

Uploaded to GH for backup purposes. With the exception of PDFs, Word and powerpoint files incase they contain any personal information to anyone invovled.
